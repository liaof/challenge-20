            <p>
            I am a MERN-stack web developer based in the Greater Toronto Area, specialising in building mobile friendly online experiences for small buisnesses. 
            My 6 years of programming and background in comp-sci provides a natural foundation for web development and design.
            Most recently, I graduated from the Uoft SCS Web Development Boot Camp. I enjoy designing solutions via code, and am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my skillset and exchange knowledge.
            <br/> <br/>

            Beyond my work in programming, I am a classically trained pianist, and I enjoy taking long walks with my dog, watching horror movies, playing video games, and spending time with my family.
